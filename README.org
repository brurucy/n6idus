* Sorted Set

Hey.

This is a project of mine where I'm implementing a *very* effective sorted set data structure.

It is faster, or the same speed, as all these libraries:

1. https://github.com/qwertie/btree-typescript
2. https://github.com/vadimg/js_bintrees#readme
3. https://github.com/mikolalysenko/functional-red-black-tree#treegetkey
4. https://github.com/montagejs/collections

The main advantage over all of these, is that it supports indexing *by position* in O(log(log(n))) time complexity, while all others are O(n).

As an example look how long it takes for each to find, in order, 1 million elements, versus position indexing:

https://github.com/grantjenks/python-sortedcontainers has a *very* similar data structure, and it is the main source of inspiration.
