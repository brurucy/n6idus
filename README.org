* Sorted Set

Hey.

This is a project of mine where I'm implementing a *very* effective sorted set data structure.

It is faster, or the same speed, as all these libraries:

1. https://github.com/qwertie/btree-typescript
2. https://github.com/vadimg/js_bintrees#readme
3. https://github.com/mikolalysenko/functional-red-black-tree#treegetkey
4. https://github.com/montagejs/collections

The main advantage over all of these, is that it supports indexing *by position* in amortized O(log(B)) time complexity, where B is constant, while all others are O(n).

To implement:

- forward iteration by position
- forward iteration by value
- reverse iteration by position
- reverse iteration by value
- range forward iteration by position
- range forward iteration by value
- range backwards iteration by position
- range backwards iteration by value
- bulk delete by position
- bulk delete by value
- getMin
- getMax
- popMin
- popMax
- nextHigherKey
- nextLowerKey
- toArray
