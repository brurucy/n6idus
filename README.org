* Sorted Set

Hey.

This is a project of mine where I'm implementing a *very* effective sorted set data structure.

It is faster, or the same speed, as all these libraries:

1. https://github.com/qwertie/btree-typescript
2. https://github.com/vadimg/js_bintrees#readme
3. https://github.com/mikolalysenko/functional-red-black-tree#treegetkey
4. https://github.com/montagejs/collections

The main advantage over all of these, is that it supports indexing *by position* in amortized O(log(B)) time complexity, where B is constant, while all others are O(n).

To implement:

- getMin
- getMax
- popMin
- popMax
- nextHigherKey
- nextLowerKey
- filter
- every
- some

Release plan:

1. 0.1.0 - The current indexed sorted set implementation
2. 0.2.0 - A not-indexed sorted set implementation (halfway done)
3. 0.3.0 - An indexed sorted set with hash
